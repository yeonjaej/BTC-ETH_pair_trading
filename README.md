# BTC-ETH Statistical Arbitrage Strategy ğŸ“ŠğŸ’±

This repository implements a market-neutral **pair trading strategy** on BTC and ETH using **statistical arbitrage** techniques. The strategy dynamically estimates the hedge ratio using rolling OLS regression and detects mean-reversion in the spread via z-score thresholds.

## ğŸ§  Strategy Overview

- Constructs a rolling spread:  
  \[
  Spread(t) = BTC(t) âˆ’ Î²(t)Â·ETH(t)
  \]
- Applies z-score thresholds to detect deviations from the spread mean
- Enters long/short positions based on spread divergence
- Exits trades when the spread reverts near its mean
- Simulates PnL with fees
